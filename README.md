My project is a scientific calculator that takes binary operations, sqrt function, and converting between DEC,HEX,OCT,BIN. 
We can just run the program basically, and start doing the ops.
The base form initially is DEC, which enables to use all the operations, and also switching between bases.
However, in any base except DEC, our calc buttons are unabled (I only wanted to do calculation on decimal numbers)
On sqrt, raising an error whenever trying to find a sqrt of a negative number
Multiple operations work on most cases (the ones i tried)
Functions:
reset-its resetting our calculator, all stored numbers,operators will be cleared, and its initial state will be in 0
format_number-if we have an integer, we will remove the decimal part and display it as a string, bcs tkinter.label is for displaying text mainly
button_clicked-in here we r handling all buttons,performing the calculations,like any conversion,binary op etc.
update_buttons-its for disabling the buttons whenever our current base is not DEC, stating the buttons disabled.
valbin,valdhex,valoct- these funcs are just basically convert the nums into these bases respectively, BIN (only 0/1), HEX(0123456789abcdef), OCT(01234567)
